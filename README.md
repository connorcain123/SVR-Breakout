# Stroke Visual Rehabilitation - Breakout

A recreation of the classic arcade game breakout. The paddle moves based on where the player is looking, the trick to stay in the game is to follow the ball around the screen, that way the paddle stays right below the ball each time. This project is apart of the suite of games created for the stroke rehabilatation project. This game was created in Unity using c# scripts and Tobii's eye tracker and SDK. This was one of my contributions to the overall project.
